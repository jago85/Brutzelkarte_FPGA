# Brutzelkarte_FPGA
The Brutzelkarte FPGA description code in VHDL

The code may need some cleanup. It is the result of multiple iterations from the first prototype to the current version. It may not be perfect but works. There are still some unimplemented features.

Feel free to leave me a message if you find bugs or have suggestions for improvements.
